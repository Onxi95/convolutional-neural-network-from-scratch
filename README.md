# Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch

## About the Project

This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence course offered by the Warsaw University of Technology. It involves the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch, using only NumPy to understand the fundamentals of CNN operations, including convolutional layers, pooling, and backpropagation.

### Project Objectives

- To understand the underlying mathematics and operations of convolutional neural networks.
- To implement the forward and backward passes of a CNN from scratch.
- To apply the CNN on a dataset (specify dataset here) for image classification tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizing the results)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Create virtualenv
4. Activate virtualenv and install dependencies

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
